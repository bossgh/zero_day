This is my first project. Here are the steps how I created this repository: 1. Navigate to your home directory. 2. Create a directory zero_day. 3. Navigate to this new directory. 4. Initialize git and add the remote origin. 5. Create a file README.md. 6. Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message “My first commit” and push to the remote server / origin.
